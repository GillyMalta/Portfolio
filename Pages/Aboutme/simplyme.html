        <p>What can  I say... '77 kid, Gen X born in an age of transformation and cultural shifts. 
            <br><br>
            According to CHATGPT or Cettina as I like to call her. Truth be told, my wife Sylvana came up with 
            the monicker... based on Chat... In the 1970'w Malta, Cetta (derivative of Concetta) was a popular female name.
            So Chat, Cett... Cettina! 
            <br><br>
            
            Back to the 70's. According to Cettina those years will be remembered as: 
            <ul> <strong>A Time of...</strong>
                <li><strong>Cultural Transformation:</strong> Shifting values after the 60s</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Struggle:</strong> Inflation, oil crisis</li>
                <li><strong>Technological beginnings:</strong> First home computers, early video games</li>
            </ul>
            And this is the age of technology I was born and raised in.
            <br><br>
            My first memory of technology is a black and white TV, no remote of course and a couple of (government owned and run propaganda) channels.
            If my memory serves me well, I vaguely remember a calculator... but again, at the tail-end of the 70's I was only 3 years old.
            <br><br>
            Fast forward to 1987 the year that established by technological revolution! 
            <br>My father bought me my 1st computer... 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memotech_MTX" target="_blank" title="Link to wikipedia">a Memotech MTX 512</a>
                It ran BASIC and as the cursor blinked blankly at me, and after reading the manual (RTFM) I typed my first command:
                <br>10 RANDOMISE TIME
